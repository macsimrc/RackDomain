	  <h3>What expect and why?</h3>
	  <p>The main reason on which this application was developed was the need to have an on-line tool that lets us manage information of a rack infrastructure.
		Free applications do not provide any flexibility and can not be adapted to our specific needs. The ability to manage the information of telecommunications infrastructure assets of any
		enterprise make to this application a great option. Personally this application is the result of one and half year of hard work and it was the major self-training experience in my career.
		Rack Domain provides some basic tools to create a network infrastructure based on the creation of a virtually site components who store rooms, rows, racks, and telecommunications devices
		with their respective attributes, that structure helps us to identify actual and future needs and other specific tasks. So lets go ahead!</p>

	  <h3>How?</h3>
	  <p>Rack Domain is entirely developed using open source software and open source tools, by now Rack Domain is free and you can download the source files from <a href="https://github.com/macsimrc/RackDomain">GitHub</a>.
	  The main App is built in Yii Framework and it's writing in many languages like PHP, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, SQL and Others. The use of this tools and languages correspond to
	  the popularity of them on the actual development on Internet applications, and it provides a start point for improvement and future development of Rack Domain application.</p>

	  <h3>What's next?</h3>
	  <p>What's next is not easy but it is very important, the idea is to continue expanding the capacity of Rack Domain application and continue creating additional modules to 
		expand the tasks and the characteristics, the biggest challenge is to achieve a world-class application and this is the main purpose.</p>
